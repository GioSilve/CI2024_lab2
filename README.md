## Algorithms used
- Greedy algorithm
- Inversion mutation
- Partially Mapped Crossover

## Description
Starting with a population composed of an individual obtained with a greedy algorithm and of individuals created by randomly modifying copies of the initial one, we evolve the population every iteration by choosing two parents, applying inverse mutation on each of them and then partially mapped crossover on the obtained mutated parents to generate two offsprings, stopping when the maximum number of generations is reached.
